# mmm-mixin-collection
A Collection of .SASS Mixins + Functions (in a short time also in .SCSS) that are used to minimize the work needed to apply styling/properties to elements. MMM is not just a collection to help with cross browser support, so it is best paired with autoprefixer, for the best possible browser compatibility. Remember tha you can conbine this mixins as you need. Hope this compendium, will be valuable to you :)
